Deadline 17 November 2011, 23.59: Group registration and project planning. 

You should form your group and register it strictly following the directions that will be published on the course website and will be presented during the project lab. Also, you will submit your project plan in which you will identify the tasks that you will execute during the project, the responsible person for each task and will provide a rough estimate of the required effort. To support you in quantifying this effort we will provide by November the 3rd on the course website some statistics from last year project. Make sure that you start working at your plan immediately so that you can move to the next phase (see below) BEFORE the deadline of the 17th.

- System Administrator Interface

.: The developer team firstly thought about implementing
a GUI for the system administrator on the server side.
Although, during the Design phase, after spending more 
time studying the JEE software architecture,
the team discovered that such a feature was not really
necessary and could waste too much time for the implementation.
Instead of a GUI, and because the Database is built on a
MySQL Server, the system administrator can make use of
the MySQL Workbench, a graphical tool which makes
manual DBMS operations easy.
